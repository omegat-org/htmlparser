<div class=MsoNormal>This is an open source parser for HTML, which was
made by Somik Raha during development of a product at Kizna Corporation.
Since this is not our main line of products, Kizna Corporation has decided
to open source this, so that it may benefit other developers. This is released
under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">LGPL</a>. Kizna
Corporation disclaims all copyright of this product.

<p>[1] Bug fix in HTMLStyleScanner, which was causing the parser to crash
on encountering style tags.
<p><b>Version 1.00 contains :</b>

scanner registration. Architecture has been simplified a lot.
<br>[2] Major bug fixes - several bugs have been fixed, lots of testcases

look at the javadoc for the HTMLParser class, especially the elements()
method. This has a lot of info to get you started.
<p>With this release, HTMLParser has made the transition from an alpha
to a <b>beta</b> stage. Modifications hereafter will be only of a maintenance
nature and API is not expected to change.</div>
