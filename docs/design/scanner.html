<b><u>The Scanner - Tag Hierarchy</u></b>

<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="93%" >
<tr>
<td>An abstract HTMLTagScanner evaluates a tag, to indicate whether it
can handle it. The scan() method defines what happens if evaluate() returns
true.
<br>In the diagram below, you can see concrete HTMLLinkScanner creating
an HTMLLinkTag in its scan() method, and similarly for HTMLAppletScanner
creating an HTMLAppletTag.
<p>HTMLNode is the parent interface for HTMLTag, from which the specific
tags are derived. From this hierarchy it is clear that, in order to extend
support in the parser for your own tag set, you need to write a scanner-tag
pair.&nbsp;

<td WIDTH="60%">The figure shows the various scanners currently being supported.
Apart from the special "template methods" - evaluate() and scan(), you
will find several other utility methods which help in the writing of scanners.
Of great utility will be methods like absorbLeadingBlanks() and extractField().
Of interest is the method extractXMLData(). This allows basic XML Tag set
support. If the tag name being searched is specified, it is read, and provided.
<p>This will enable extensive XML parsing support, especially dynamic parsing,
when the complete XML is not available as is often the case with more and
more softwares choosing XML as their data output format.</td>
