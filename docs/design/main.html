        You can browse the javadoc of all the classes from this link. The Javadoc 
        of the classes, particularly <a href="http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/htmlparser/HTMLParser.html">HTMLParser</a>, 
        contains a lot of information that will help you understand how to use 
        the parser. If you're the quintessential java programmer who just needs 
        good javadoc to get started, this is the place to look. We recommend you 
        focus initially on the <a href="http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/htmlparser/package-summary.html">org.htmlparser</a> 
        and <a href="http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/htmlparser/tags/package-summary.html">org.htmlparser.tags</a> 
        packages. <br>

  <tr> 
    <td><a href="../samples/index.html"><strong>Getting Started</strong></a><br>
      There's no better way of getting started than to look at <a href="../samples/index.html">Sample 
      programs</a> made with the parser. You should find most of the programs 
      that you'd ever want to make. Most of the Sample Programs have design commentaries, 
      so you can also treat this as a tutorial on the parser and its design. <br>

    <td><strong><a href="design.html">HTMLParser</a></strong><a href="design.html"><strong> 
      - Patterns Used</strong></a><br>
      The design of HTML Parser has evolved over a period of time (over a year 
      now) with input from various experts. A lot of refactorings have taken place, 
      and a couple of patterns have come in which makes for interesting study. 
      If you are the OO-nerd who loves to understand hierarchies and frameworks, 
      you might find this interesting. <br>

        the XP paradigm of Test-Driven Development.</p>
