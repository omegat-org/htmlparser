Integration Build 1.2 - 20020728
--------------------------------
[1] Fixed bug in HTMLParser.openConnection(), mistaking 
files for urls if they contain "http" or "www" anywhere.
[2] Updated HTMLEndTag, this was accidentally left out in the 
previous release.
[3] Fixed Bug 586062 - relative links bug - if first char is a 
slash, then the subdirectories of the url need to be ignored.
[4] Fixed Bug 586222 - HTMLRemarkNode bug - if a line with a remark 
ndoe contains a string before it, the string is ignored.
[5] Fixed major bug - allowing auto-correction
of malformed tags. Current code is very robust. Fix allowed removal of 
strictness vector concept, making the design simpler.
[6] Fixed bug 586756 - in HTMLRemarkNode, if there are empty lines only, the 
finite state machine would crash

Integration Build 1.2 - 20020721
--------------------------------
[1] Fixed HTMLStringNode bug, whereby it wasnt able to 
skip some wierd Microsoft tags (endif)
[2] Fixed a deep bug in HTMLTag.java, the parser would crash
on http://www.cybergeo.presse.fr/culture/weili/weili.htm
[3] Fixed bug in HTMLTagScanner.java, in absorbLeadingBlanks()
[4] Fixed bug in HTMLEndTag, allowing more robustness now in 
scanning malformed end tags

Integration Build 1.2 - 20020707
--------------------------------
[1] Fixed major slowdown bug in HTMLStringNode.find().
This version is twice as fast as ver 1.1.
[2] Fixed bug in ScriptScanner, would break on incorrect
html inside script code. 
[3] Removed FormScanner from standard registered scanners
as it has a bug in parsing non-ended forms (infinite loop).

Integration Build 1.2 - 20020630
--------------------------------
[1] Fixed bug in linking of meta and title tags
with their scanners
[2] Fixed bug in parsing broken tags
[3] Refactored design - scan() returns a HTMLTag now, 
and is called inside a template method createScannedNode()
inside HTMLTagScanner. Scanner designers dont have to
worry about making links with the scanner and the tag
created, and forcing of attribute parsing. HTMLEndTag
is now a HTMLTag, hence there is more uniformity in the interface now.
[4] Fixed bug in HTMLLinkScanner, enabling it to 
parse broken links.
[5] Title Tags linked to -T instead of -t (clashing earlier with style tags)

Integration Build 1.2 - 20020623
--------------------------------
[1] Refactored HTMLAppletScanner
[2] Refactored HTMLScriptScanner
[3] Added testcases for script scanner
[4] Refactored HTMLTagScanner (removed extractField)
[5] Fixed bug in HTMLLinkScanner - would crash on freshmeat.net,
bcos of <a>Revision</a>. Now this is being treated as three
seperate nodes(tag, string node, end tag)
[6] Fixed ant script bug, not allowing it to be run from the command
line by issuing the ant command.
[7] Redesigned HTMLFormScanner, testcases written, included in package
[8] Refactored HTMLImageScanner evaluate() method to be more optimized
[9] Redesigned HTMLFrameScanner, testcases written, also written 
HTMLFrameSetScanner.
[10] Fixed bug in HTMLTag, now parseParameters is automatically
called only once, when either getParsed(), or getParameter() is invoked.
[11] toRawString() renamed to toHTML() - intention revealing name

Integration Build 1.2 - 20020616
--------------------------------
[1] Fixed multiple line bug (reported by Gordon Deudney).
HTMLStringNode now scans a complete string block, instead
of producing string node objects per line.
[2] Refactored HTMLScriptScanner, code size reduced, made
consistent with design

Integration Build 1.2 - 20020607
--------------------------------
Incorporated bug fixes by Wolfgang Germund
In HTMLScriptScanner - the html extracted with toRawString
did not mirror the actual html data.

Integration Build 1.2 - 20020512
--------------------------------
[1] Made Link Scanner more fault tolerant.
Can handle bad links like
<A HREF="..."><IMG></td><td ...><A href="..">...</a>

In the above, the first link is correctly ended before</td>

<A HREF="..."><IMG><A HREF="...">...</a>

The first link is correctly ended before the second link begins

[2] Bug in HTMLLinkProcessor fixed. Relative links were spuriously
identified even if they used a non-http protocol (like ftp, gopher).

Nightly Build 1.2 - 20020507
----------------------------
[1] HTMLNode is no longer an interface, but an abstract class. There were two reasons for this change. Firstly, I couldnt think of a scenario where an object would be an html tag AND something else. Secondly, I wanted to enforce the implementation of toString(), which is usually done if you implement from the interface (as Object has a default toString()).
[2] abstract toString() method - children have to implement this.
[3] print() and print(PrintWriter) - final methods. They will make a call to toString(), and print to standard output and the print writer respectively.
[4] toPlainText() - this method will provide a string representation of a tag, if there is such a representation. If not , a blank string is returned. This has implications - our program to extract all strings from a html page will be simplified to:

HTMLNode node;
for (Enumeration e = parser.elements();e.hasMoreElements();) {
    node = (HTMLNode)e.nextElement();
    System.out.println(node.toPlainTextString()); // or whatever processing you want to do with the string
}

[5] toRawString() - this method provides the complete html element (a reconstruction), thus allowing ripping programs to be really simple. So if you want to rip the html page to your local hard disk, your program would look like,

PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("..."));
for (Enumeration e = parser.elements();e.hasMoreElements();) {
    node = (HTMLNode)e.nextElement();
    pw.println(node.toRawString());
}
pw.close();

[6] Lots of bug fixes done - HTMLImageScanner had a bug, HTMLStyleScanner also had one - all caught with more testcases.

Nightly Build 1.2 - 20020503
----------------------------
[1] Major fix - Dirty parsing of erroneous inverted commas possible
[2] Tags spread out on multiple lines, with blank lines in between are supported
[3] Bug in HTMLStringNode fixed, so as to be able to parse tag characters < and >
[4] Image tag parameters not being retrieved, bug fixed
[5] Added HTMLFormScanner, HTMLFrameScanner, HTMLFormTag, HTMLFrameTag - but these
are not yet integrated with the code, pending testcases.

Please use this nightly build for testing purposes, in case any of the bugs listed
above are causing you problems. This release will become a stable release
after adequate testing.

Production Release ver 1.1 (Stable)
-----------------------------------
[1] Added META and TITLE tag scanners
[2] Fixed spaces bug in HTMLLinkScanner and HTMLImageScanner. The parser
now supports links or urls with spaces in them. Functionality
modification - HTMLTag no longer absorbs spaces. It reports data as is,
and leaves the responsibility of processing to the particular scanner.
[3] Fixed XML parsing bug - isXMLTagFound() in HTMLTagScanner - it no longer checks for equality,
but for the beginning of an xml tag
[4] HTMLTag bug - if a link is spread over two lines, the parser would crash.
[5] Dynamic Page Parsing supported (urls need not end with .html anymore)
[6] Dirty HTML of the form <A HREF="http://www.somelink.com">abcd<A>, is now correctly 
handled. The second <A> is taken as </A>.

Maintenance Release ver 1.04
----------------------------
[1] Bug fix in HTMLTag, now caught by test case in HTMLTagTest. Will cause incorrect parsing for JSP tags, which have end tag symbols in inverted commas. 
[2] Bug fix in HTMLLinkParser - would crash for link tags which have no link in them. Test case also added. 
[3] More test cases added, for ImageTag as well, and HTMLTag also. 

Maintenance Release ver 1.03
----------------------------
This version contains the following bug fix :
[1] Bug in HTMLRemarkNode, now caught by test case in HTMLRemarkNodeTest. Will cause incorrect parsing if remarks are spread across lines.

Maintenance Release ver 1.02
----------------------------
This version contains the following bug fix :
[1] Bug in HTMLStyleScanner, now caught by test case in HTMLStyleScannerTest - would end up crashing on parsing google.
[2] Changed encoding support to 8859_4 for English and most European languages - this fixes some crashes observed on finnish pages

Maintenance Release ver 1.01
----------------------------
[1] Bug in HTMLStyleScanner fixed

Release Notes for Ver 1.00
--------------------------
This version contains :
[1] Major architecture overhaul - significant change : no more static scanner registration. Architecture has been simplified a lot.
[2] Major bug fixes - several bugs have been fixed, lots of testcases added, and stability vastly improved.
[3] Improved documentation - The javadoc is now substantial. Please look at the javadoc for the HTMLParser class, especially the elements() method. This has a lot of info to get you started.

From this release, HTML Parser enters the beta stage (Alpha stage is finally over - phew!). From now on, the API will not be changed significantly, and future releases would be of a maintenance nature.

Q1. What are the contents of the distribution ? 
Q2. Which part of the source code should I analyze to be able to use it in my project ? 
Q3. How do I extend the capability of this library ? 
*********************************************************
Q1. What are the contents of the distribution ?

A1. The distribution contains :
    (i) binary jar file - htmlparser.jar (in lib directory)
    (ii) source code - src.zip (in distribution directory)
    (iii) documentation - doc directory (includes javadoc)
    (iv) Executing scripts - There are three scripts (in the bin directory):
         (a) runParser.bat  : Runs the html parser
         (b) runCrawler.bat : Runs the robot crawler
         (c) runRipper.bat  : Runs the mail ripper   
         All three batch files assume that java 1.2 (or upwards) is visible in your path.

Issue the following command : 
java -jar htmlparser.jar myURL (or runParser myURL)

The following are legal examples of usage: 
java -jar htmlparser.jar http://www.yahoo.com  (or runParser http://www.yahoo.com)
java -jar htmlparser.jar http://www.google.com -l (or runParser http://www.google.com -l)
java -jar htmlparser.jar c:\html\test.html (or runParser c:\html\test.html)

To see a list of options, simply type : 
java -jar htmlparser.jar 

and the switches allowed will be shown.

Q2. Which part of the source code should I analyze to be able to use it in my project ?

Go through the javadoc of HTMLParser.java - it contains all the examples to get you started.

Also go through the package com.kizna.parserapplications. 
The two applications here, Robot and MailRipper, have been expressly written for the purpose of demonstrating the usage of htmlparser.

---------- *** ------------

Q3. How do I extend the capability of this library ?

You need to extend the HTMLTagScanner in order to take advantage of existing 
code to identify a generic tag. You could add further processing code based 
on the tag contents. For more information on how to do this, examine the code 
of the scanners in the com.kizna.html.scanners package. The scanners 
basically use a Template Method+Factory Method approach. You need to 
override the evaluate() and scan() methods, and register your 
scanner to the parser before you begin parsing.

This process is simple, check the com.kizna.html.scanners package
to see how the existing scanners work.
