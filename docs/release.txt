 (ii) source code - src.zip
      Also contains necessary resources, and build file. Unzip this
      and you should be all set to build the parser from its source.
      You would need Jakarta Ant installed.

Changes since Version 1.4
-------------------------
New APIs
    Implement rudimentary sax parser. Currently exposes DOM parser via sax project 
	A new http package is added, the primary class being Connectionmanager which
	handles proxies, passwords and cookies. Some testing still needed.
	Also removed some line separator cruft.
Configuration Management
    Removed the need for the Translate class to be packaged with htmllexer.jar.
    This results in a lighter weight component.
    Updated the logo and included the LGPL license.
    Fixed the Windows batch files.
Refactoring
    Obviated LinkProcessor and moved it's functionality to the Page class.
    Added Tag, Text and Remark interfaces and moved concrete node
    implementations to the nodes package, removing the lexer.nodes package.
    Most internals now use the Tag interface.
    Removed the org.htmlparser.tags.Tag class and moved the remaining (minor)
    functionality to the TagNode class.
    So now tags inherit directly from TagNode or CompositeTag.
	** NOTE: If you have subclassed org.htmlparser.tags.Tag, use org.htmlparser.nodes.TagNode now.**
    Removed deprecated methods getTagBegin/getTagEnd and deleted unused classes:
        PeekingIterator and it's Implementation.
    Added ObjectTag (like an applet tag).
    Added a real StringSource that reads directly from a String rather than
    creating a byte array. This avoids character encoding losses.
    Incorporate patch #1004985 Page.java, by making getCharset() and findCharset() static.
    Incorporated some speed optimizations based on profiling.
Filters
    Added CssSelectorNodeFilter and RegExFilter.
    Added the filter builder tool.
