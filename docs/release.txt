Q1. What are the contents of the distribution ?

Q3. How do I extend the capability of this library ?

Q1. What are the contents of the distribution ?

A1. The distribution contains :
    (i) binary jar files - htmlparser.jar and lexer.jar (in lib directory)
    
    (ii) source code - src.zip (in distribution directory)
    	 Also contains necessary resources, and build file. Unzip this
    	 and you should be all set to build the parser from its source.
    	 You would need Jakarta Ant already installed to run the script.
    	 
    (iii) documentation - doc directory (includes javadoc)
    
    (iv) Executing scripts - There are three scripts (in the bin directory):
         (a) runParser.bat  : Runs the html parser
         (b) runCrawler.bat : Runs the robot crawler
         (c) runRipper.bat  : Runs the mail ripper
         (d) runLexer.bat   : Runs the low lever lexer
         (e) lexer          : Runs the low lever lexer on linux/unix
         All four batch files assume that java 1.2 (or upwards) is visible in your path.

Issue the following command : 
java -jar htmlparser.jar myURL (or runParser myURL)

The following are legal examples of usage: 
java -jar htmlparser.jar http://www.yahoo.com  (or runParser http://www.yahoo.com)
java -jar htmlparser.jar http://www.google.com -l (or runParser http://www.google.com -l)
java -jar htmlparser.jar c:\html\test.html (or runParser c:\html\test.html)

To see a list of options, simply type : 
java -jar htmlparser.jar 

and the switches allowed will be shown.

Q2. Which part of the source code should I analyze to be able to use it in my project ?

Go through the javadoc of Parser.java - it contains all the examples to get you started.

Also go through the package org.htmlparser.parserapplications. 
The two applications here, Robot and MailRipper, have been expressly written for the purpose of demonstrating the usage of htmlparser.

Q3. How do I extend the capability of this library ?

You need to extend the HTMLTagScanner in order to take advantage of existing 
code to identify a generic tag. You could add further processing code based 
on the tag contents. For more information on how to do this, examine the code 
of the scanners in the com.kizna.html.scanners package. The scanners 
basically use a Template Method+Factory Method approach. You need to 
override the evaluate() - optional,scan() and getID() methods - compulsory, and register your 
scanner to the parser before you begin parsing. 

This process is simple, check the com.kizna.html.scanners package
to see how the existing scanners work.
