HTMLParser Version 1.4 (Integration Build Jan 25, 2004)
*********************************************

Contents of the distribution
----------------------------
  (i) binary jar files - htmlparser.jar and lexer.jar (in lib directory)
    
 (ii) source code - src.zip
      Also contains necessary resources, and build file. Unzip this
      and you should be all set to build the parser from its source.
      You would need Jakarta Ant installed.
    	 
(iii) documentation - docs directory (includes javadoc)
      Point your browser at index.html in the docs directory.
    
 (iv) executing scripts - bin directory
      Batch files assume that java 1.2 (or upwards) is visible in your path.

Changes since Version 1.3
-------------------------
Decorators
    The node decorator package has been added to provide support for the
    delegate model.
Lexer
    A new lexer i/o subsystem has been added. This provides accurate line number
    and character position data, tag and attribute names maintain their original
    case, and attributes maintain their original order. Line numbers reported by
    tags are now zero based, not one based. The node count for parsing goes up
    in most cases because whitespace is strictly maintained, i.e. every
    whitespace (i.e. newline) now counts as a StringNode too. Storage of
    attributes is now in a Vector which means the element 0 Attribute is
    actually the name of the tag, rather than having the $TAGNAME entry in a
    HashTable. The htmllexer.jar is this new i/o subsystem broken out and made
    JDK 1.1 compliant, the htmlparser.jar, which includes everything in
    htmllexer.jar, is not necessarily intended to be used in JDK 1.1
    environments. Some support for JIS escape sequences has been added.
Tags
    Zero arg tag constructors have been added. Attribute maintenance
    (add/remove/edit) improved. There is no EndTag class any more. Just a
    generic tag that responds true to isEndTag(). Improvements to form tag
    handling, getting <input> and <textarea> tags nested within other tags.
    Improvements to applet tag handling regarding parameters and codebases.
Scanners
    The concept of scanners has been completely reworked. Applications register
    tags not scanners to express interest in parsing only some tags. The default
    is now to parse all tags, which is equivalent to the old registerDOMTags(),
    so some extra nesting of tags will need to be handled. CompositeTagScanner
    logic has been improved to try and match unclosed open tags when an
    unexpected end tag is encountered. This change also moved recursion off the
    JDK stack, eliminating most StackOverflow exceptions. Also, a CompositeTag's
    "startTag()" is "this", and the CompositeTagScanner just adds children.
Filters
    A new powerful filtering capability has been added, which makes extracting
    specific tags very easy.
Applications
    New example applications Thumbelina and SiteCapturer.
