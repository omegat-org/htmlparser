<h2>Support Request</h2>
<p>You can submit support requests here. Before you proceed, please note that 
  you <strong>must</strong> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/account/login.php">sign 
  in at sourceforge</a>, for only then will our responses reach you. Putting in 
  an anonymous bug report will provide us with no way of reaching you. If you 
  do not have a sourceforge login, then please consider mentioning your email 
  address in the bug report. Anonymous support requests just dont make sense, 
  so we will not be replying to anonymous reports.<br>
  <br>
  Please note that this is an open source project, and most of us are hard pressed 
  for time. We are not obliged to help you but we do so anyway. You can help us 
  by first researching your problem, and then requesting for support when you 
  are really stuck. You should have gone through the <a href="sample/index.html">sample 
  programs</a>, and <a href="design/index.html" target="_parent">documentation</a> 
  before you submit your request. It might also be much faster to get help from 
  the htmlparser user community, by signing up on the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/htmlparser-user">HTMLParser 
  User mailing list</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Once you are ready, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=24399&atid=381400">click 
  here to submit your report</a>.</p>
