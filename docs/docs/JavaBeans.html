Use the Go menu to go back to a previous link or step to the next link you already visited.</P><P>The options menu provides access to the binary properties:<BR/></P><P><BR/></P><UL><LI>Links - turn on and off the extraction of hyperlinks with the text</LI><LI>Collapse - turn on and off collapsing whitespace</LI><LI>Non-Breaking Spaces - turn on and off transforming non-break spaces into regular spaces</LI></UL><P><B>Simple Usage</B></P><P>The simplest operation (this shows StringBean use, but LinkBean use is similar) is just to create a new one, set the URL and then get the text:<BR/></P><PRE>#import org.htmlparser.beans.StringBean;

}</PRE><P>Save this in a file called TryBeans.java and then run the following commands:</P><PRE>javac -classpath htmlparser.jar TryBeans.java
java -classpath htmlparser.jar:. TryBeans</PRE><P>or for Windows:</P><PRE>java -classpath htmlparser.jar;. TryBeans</PRE><P><B>Simple GUI Usage</B></P><P>The following instructions are for the <A CLASS="namedurl" HREF="http://www.netbeans.org"><SPAN STYLE="white-space: nowrap">NetBeans</SPAN></A> IDE but other environments will have a similar operation.</P><P>You can mount the htmlparser.jar file:<BR/></P><P><BR/></P><P>and use the bean classes directly or if you want to use them in the Form designer you'll need to install them. Use the Install New Javabean menu item in the Tools menu:<BR/></P><P><BR/></P><P>There are a number of beans in the jar, as indicated above the GUI beans are the HTMLStringBean and HTMLLinkBean. You can install them all, but it might clutter up your palette a bit, so I would recomend only install the ones you need for the project at hand. You'll also need to specify the palette that the beans will be added to:</P><P><BR/></P><P>Once the bean is installed it will show up on the tool palette and you can click it and drop it onto a JFrame or JPanel or whatever:<BR/></P><P><BR/></P><P>Once it's in your designer you can set the properties and have it display the text even while designing (assuming you're online):<BR/></P><P><BR/></P><P>Of course you can subclass the provided beans or write your own.</P></DIV><DIV ID="actionbar" CLASS="toolbar"><HR NOSHADE="noshade" CLASS="printer"/><P CLASS="editdate">Last edited on Saturday, April  5, 2003  7:25:55 pm.</P><HR NOSHADE="noshade" CLASS="toolbar"/></body></html>
