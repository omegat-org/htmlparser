<p>Welcome to my space on the HTMLParser wiki. I founded the HTMLParser project two years back, under the confusion that there were no other html parsers around. Since then, it has been one exciting journey - made possible because of the vast feedback that has been pouring in, that really shows the power of the open-source movement.

<p>You can visit my <a href="http://www.geocities.com/somik/index.html" class="namedurl"><span style="white-space: nowrap">home</span> page</a> to see some of my other work.
