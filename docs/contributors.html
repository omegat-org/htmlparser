    <td width="39%"><p>Somik is the lead programmer and project manager of HTMLParser. 
        He started the project while he was working <a href="http://www.kizna.com">at 
        Kizna Corporation, Japan</a>. He is thankful to Kizna for allowing him 
        to open source the parser, as it was not what Kizna was making. </p>
      <p>Thereafter, hundreds of people wrote back, asking for modifications, 
        giving design suggestions, bug reports, etc. and making the parser what 
        it is today. The parser is truly a collaborative effort with people from 
        different countries, companies, cultures.</p></td>
    <td width="36%"><p><strong><br>
        Somik on India </strong></p>
      <p>India is a massive multi-cultural nation, home to over a billion people, 
        a hustling and bustling democracy. </p>
      <p>India has 27 states, and over 40 languages and dialects. Don't be surprised 
        if you find two Indians communicating with each other in English - for 
        that might be the only common language they share.</p>
      <p>Food in India is awesome, with each state having its own cuisine. India's 
        population includes Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Jains, Buddhists, Jews, 
        Parsees and many others. Two famous Indian exports are : Yoga and Software 
        :) </p></td>

    <td><p>Kaarle was one of the first users of the parser. He contributed a critical 
        method - parseParameters(). This method is present today in the HTMLParameterParser 
        class and it picks up all the attributes in a given tag. </p>
      <p>This method is surprisingly hard to write - as it handles various kinds 
        of dirty html available, and it has proved to be the single most used 
        method in the parser.</p>
      <p>Kaarle has used the parser in the J2EE extranet project at Nokia.</p></td>
    <td><p><strong><br>
        Kaarle on Finland</strong></p>
      <p>Finland might today be best known for Nokia
        but we are not only that. Did you know that
        according to Forbes magazine the richest 
        (imaginary?) person lives in Finland. Who 
        might that be? Hint: he travels with reindeer
        and he is most active in christmas time.
        Perhaps you knew that the reindeer is a common 
        domestic animal in northern Finland (Lapland). </p>
      <p>There's about 5 million of us here. We have more 
        than 60 000 lakes and much more small islands 
        both in the lakes and on the seaside. Some of
        us (like me) have their own island. You can find 
        a picture of my island on my webpage if you look for it. Of course I have 
        a sauna on the island. <br>

    <td><p>Claude made very important contributions to the parser, by doing massive

        scalability of the parser.</p>
      <p>Claude also contributed greatly to the design of the parser - giving 
        it a professional touch. Some of his important contributions include chained 
        exceptions and the feedback mechanism.</p>
      <p>Claude Duguay has developed software for more than 20 years. He is passionate 
        about Java, reads about it incessantly, and writes about it as often as
