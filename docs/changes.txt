Production Release ver 1.1
--------------------------
[1] Added META and TITLE tag scanners
[2] Fixed spaces bug in HTMLLinkScanner and HTMLImageScanner. The parser
now supports links or urls with spaces in them. Functionality
modification - HTMLTag no longer absorbs spaces. It reports data as is,
and leaves the responsibility of processing to the particular scanner.
[3] Fixed XML parsing bug - isXMLTagFound() in HTMLTagScanner - it no longer checks for equality,
but for the beginning of an xml tag
[4] HTMLTag bug - if a link is spread over two lines, the parser would crash.
[5] Dynamic Page Parsing supported (urls need not end with .html anymore)
[6] Dirty HTML of the form <A HREF="http://www.somelink.com">abcd<A>, is now correctly 
handled. The second <A> is taken as </A>.

Maintenance Release ver 1.04
----------------------------
[1] Bug fix in HTMLTag, now caught by test case in HTMLTagTest. Will cause incorrect parsing for JSP tags, which have end tag symbols in inverted commas. 
[2] Bug fix in HTMLLinkParser - would crash for link tags which have no link in them. Test case also added. 
[3] More test cases added, for ImageTag as well, and HTMLTag also. 

Maintenance Release ver 1.03
----------------------------
This version contains the following bug fix :
[1] Bug in HTMLRemarkNode, now caught by test case in HTMLRemarkNodeTest. Will cause incorrect parsing if remarks are spread across lines.

Maintenance Release ver 1.02
----------------------------
This version contains the following bug fixes :
[1] Bug in HTMLStyleScanner, now caught by test case in HTMLStyleScannerTest - would end up crashing on parsing google.
[2] Changed encoding support to 8859_4 for English and most European languages - this fixes some crashes observed on Finnish pages

Maintenance Release ver 1.01
----------------------------
This version contains the following bug fix :
[1] Bug in HTMLStyleScanner, now caught by test case in HTMLStyleScannerTest - would end up crashing on standard style tags

Rel - ver 1.00
--------------
This version contains :
[1] Major architecture overhaul - significant change : no more static scanner registration. Architecture has been simplified a lot.
[2] Major bug fixes - several bugs have been fixed, lots of testcases added, and stability vastly improved.
[3] Improved documentation - The javadoc is now substantial. Please look at the javadoc for the HTMLParser class, especially the elements() method. This has a lot of info to get you started.

From this release, HTML Parser enters the beta stage (Alpha stage is finally over - phew!). From now on, the API will not be changed significantly, and future releases would be of a maintenance nature.

--------

[1] Improvements - replacements of String by StringBuffer (by Nash Tsai)
[2] Bug fix in HTMLReader (by Kaarle Kaila)
[3] Addition of mailto support in HTMLLinkScanner

Rel 0.97
--------
Bugs fixed : 
[1] HTMLStyleTag : Extra tagBegin, tagEnd present, instead of using parent's fields.
[2] HTMLLinkScanner : Scanning of URLs with a slash in the end of the base url, and a slash in the beginning of a link, 
would result in two slashes in the generated link
[3] Null Pointer Exception caused by HTMLLinkScanner, when tags beginning with A are wrongly identified as link tags.
[4] HTMLScriptScanner parsing bug, if </script> is in the same line as <script>, it isnt correctly parsed and gives
a null pointer exception
[5] HTMLImageScanner bug : When parsing images without inverted commas, it crashes.
[6] HTMLLinkScanner Bug : When parsing links without inverted commas in href, it crashes.
[7] HTMLLinkScanner Bug : When parsing links which contain images in them, it doesent recognize images. Modified now to recognize images and text uniformly.
