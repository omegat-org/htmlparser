The tags package contains specific tags.
<p>This package has implementations of tags that have functionality beyond the
capability of a generic tag. For example, the {@.html <META>} tag has methods
to get the {@link org.htmlparser.tags.MetaTag#getMetaContent CONTENT} and
{@link org.htmlparser.tags.MetaTag#getMetaTagName NAME}
attributes (although this could be done with generic attribute manipulation)
and an implementation of
{@link org.htmlparser.tags.MetaTag#doSemanticAction doSemanticAction}
that alters the lexer's encoding.</p>
<p>The classes in this package have been added in an ad-hoc fashion, with the
most useful ones having existed a long time, while some obvious ones are rather
new. Please feel free to add your own, and register them with the
{@link org.htmlparser.PrototypicalNodeFactory PrototypicalNodeFactory},
and they will be treated like any other in-built tag. In fact tags do not need
to reside in this package.</p>
<p>If the tag can contain other nodes, i.e. {@.html <h1>My Heading</h1>}, then
it should derive from (i.e. be a subclass of) {@link org.htmlparser.tags.CompositeTag}.
In this way it will inherit the
{@link org.htmlparser.scanners.CompositeTagScanner CompositeTagScanner}
and nodes between the start and end tag will be gathered into the list of
children. Most of the tags in this package derive from CompositeTag, and that
why the nodes returned from the Parser are nested.</p>
<p>If it is a simple tag, i.e. {@.html <br>}, then it should derive from
{@link org.htmlparser.nodes.TagNode TagNode}. See for example
{@link org.htmlparser.tags.MetaTag}
or {@link org.htmlparser.tags.ImageTag}.</p>
