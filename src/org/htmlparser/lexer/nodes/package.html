<TITLE>Nodes Package</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
The nodes package will eventually be the lexemes returned by the base level I/O subsystem.
<EM>It is currently under development.</EM>
There are three types of lexems so far, <code>RemarkNode</code>, <code>StringNode</code> and
<code>TagNode</code>. Within the <code>TagNode</code> objects is a list of
<code>Attribute</code> objects.<p>
The <code>Lexer</code> parses the HTML stream into a contiguous stream of these
tokens. They all implement the <code>Node</code> interface and are derived from the
<code>AbstractNode</code> class.
